Once a P1 Critical Priority Incident is resolved (whether by procedural workaround, system restart, hot-fix, or otherwise) such error's priority level shall be reclassified to a P3 –Medium Priority Incident.

b) A "P2 - High Priority Incident" means an incident which no practicable workaround is available, that prevents or materially impairs the performance of a major function of the Licensed Product as described in the Documentation so that: (i) a major function of the Licensed Product is unavailable to the Client or its availability has been materially interrupted and substantial risk of recurrence exists; or (ii) Client is unable to use the Licensed Product due to intermittent failures or data corruption; or (iii) where the Licensed Product partially fails resulting in substantial delays of key business outputs. Once a P2 - High Priority Incident is resolved (whether by procedural workaround, system restart, hot-fix, or otherwise) such error's priority level shall be changed to P3 - Medium Priority Incident.

c) A "P3 - Medium Priority Incident" means an incident which is not classified as either P1 or P2 problem whether or not a practicable workaround is available, that prevents or materially impairs the performance of a minor function in the Licensed Product as described in the Documentation so that (i) there is partial loss of functionality of a non-critical component, (ii) a single isolated error, (iii) a technical question or Licensed Product query. , whether or not a practicable workaround is available.

d) A "P4 - Low Priority Incident" means a problem that does not prevent or materially impair the performance of any function in the Licensed Product as described in the Documentation and does not materially inhibit Client's use of the Licensed Product. Such as (i) an error which is cosmetic in nature, (ii) error in Documentation, or (iii) a change request.

1.2.3 Initial Response Times meaning, the cumulative time taken from confirmation that an Incident has been raised through the SDL Support Portal during business hours to the initial technical response by SDL according to the priority levels given above are as detailed in the SDL technical Support Service Policy.

The SDL Technical Support Service Policy is available at the following link: https://rws.com/support/technical-support-service-policy/

SDL reserves the right to amend the SDL Technical Support Service Policy at its discretion, provided always the Support Level purchased by the Client does not materially change.

Section 2 Product Lifecycle Support Stages

2.1 Product Lifecycle Support Stages. The following phases are part of the Licensed Product release life cycle:

“Full” support means these releases are actively sold in the Full support phase and are actively maintained and supported. The release of Platform support updates, Hotfixes, Security fixes and Cumulative Updates for a product release in Full support will be assessed on a regular basis.

“Extended” support means support may be available as a paid option for specific product releases which are moving out of Full support. This option provides Client with additional support and maintenance services to allow the Client to plan and execute an upgrade to the latest product release.

Note: This option requires an additional support agreement between SDL and the Client.

““Retired” means product releases are no longer supported directly by SDL; ONLY access to the online Knowledge base, Documentation and Community is available. Retired means software which is no longer generally available or supported by SDL and which has reached its end of life. Retired support services will have access to the online Knowledge base, Documentation and Community where available and subject to the availability of trained SDL personnel and resources. For the avoidance of doubt, no new cumulative updates or hot fixes will be available, and there is no longer support by SDL via the support desk.

For further details please review the SDL Technical Support Service Policy.
